description: >
  This aspect covers security testing and assessment.  A security assessment is the process of determining how effectively a network, host, system, application, process/procedure or individual meets specific security objectives.  This aspect addresses the qualifications of the individual performing the assessment, the type and scope of of testing to be performed performed and the independence of the assessor from the owenership, development and maintenance of the subject being assessed.

level_one:
  - A developer who is knowledgeable about bitcoin security has assisted in the design and implementation of the information system. Having this knowledge available during the design and implementation stages helps ensure best practices are followed to minimize risk. 

level_two:
  - A single audit and/or penetration test has been completed by a third-party entity prior to – or shortly after - launch. The audit covered both static and dynamic analysis of source code to ensure secure programming patterns were used wherever applicable, and cryptographic libraries were used properly wherever they have been employed. In addition, documentation shows that all concerns raised by the audit have been addressed by the system’s team in order to remove the concerns from the system. These audits decrease the risks associated with institutional blindness and provide confidence in the organization’s controls and procedures.

level_three:
  - Security audits and/or penetration tests are performed on a defined schedule of at least once per calendar year, and documentation exists that shows how each of the concerns within the audit were addressed. Regular audits/penetration tests not only reduce the risks of unknown deficiencies in security but also reduce the overall cost of security as each audit builds on top of the last one’s results allowing for a more focused and cost effective assessment.
